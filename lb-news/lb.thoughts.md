Think step-by-step for final data, but keep minimal draft per step.

Suggestion:

1.  Last News Topics: ...
2.  Narrative Context - Time & World: ...
3.  Current Status - Situation & Location: ...
4.  Recent Notable Events In Narrative: ...
5.  #5 Suitability As Topics - Public Visibility (at the moment/now): ...
6.  Plausible New Events: ...
7.  Generated New Topics (Avoid topics from #2): ...

{{#when {{? {{getglobalvar::toggle_lightboard.thoughts}} < 3}} }}
Always include subject and object. For list items like Generated New Topics, summarize them into 3-5 essential keywords, focusing on nouns. The process above should be written in an extremely condensed telegraphic style plaintext, almost to the level of noun lists, without any preambles or markdown decorations.
