Think step-by-step for final data, but keep minimal draft per step (invisible to the user, no formatting).

Follow these steps and output each and all step (including nested steps) explicitly without omission:

1. Locate the last log entry with `[Slot #]` markers.
2. Segment the log into distinct scenes, with 1+ characters.
3. Produce Key Visual: What is the theme or most important event in the entry?
3. For each Scene + Key Visual, analyze:
   - Time and location
   - Character visuals: Appearance, attire. Reiterate required tags. Fill in missing details creatively within settings.
   - Character actions: Emotions, pose, actions.
   - Scene composition: Framing, lighting, etc.
   - Frame: What should be in and out of the frame.
   - Best slot number (for Scenes only)

If user direction or Priority Instruction exists, note them briefly.
